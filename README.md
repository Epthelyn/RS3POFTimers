Food timer for Runescape's Player Owned Farm

How to use:
- Record how much food is in each pen
- Select animals (currently does nothing)
- Watch timers slowly tick down until you have to refill pens again

The food number does not change until you enter a new number, only the time. The rate at which food decreases assumes the maximum number of animals are in a pen.
